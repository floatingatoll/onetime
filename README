OneTime for Yubikey

Note: Commercial sales of OneTime for Yubikey have been discontinued. 

OneTime makes it easy to use a Yubikey USB device with Google 2-step verification and other OATH-TOTP applications on your Mac. Unlike Google Authenticator or SMS delivery, a Yubikey with OneTime is super portable and doesn't require a smartphone, cell coverage, or SMS service. 

Best of all, OneTime does not make you re-type passwords from your device into login fields on the computer!

Key Features

- Works with GMail - Setup Google 2-step verification "out of the box" in 5 minutes
- Global Hotkey - Insert One Time Passwords at cursor location and submit, all without touching the mouse or typing a password
- Always On - Automatically starts-up on login and runs in the background in the Mac OSX Task Bar
- Yubikey Personalization - Program your Yubikey directly in the preference panel, no separate applications or conversion tools required.
- Full OATH-TOTP support - Not using GMail? OneTime can use a custom number of digits and time-step to support virtually any OATH-TOTP application

Note: This product requires a Yubikey hardware token. Buy one from Yubico to use OneTime.

Important Note about Tests

This project contains unit tests that require a Yubikey to be plugged in. These tests are run automatically when the OneTimeTest project is built. If you have an unlocked Yubikey plugged in when the tests run it WILL BE OVERWRITTEN with test keys. Please do not build and run tests for this software while you have a "production" Yubikey plugged in!
